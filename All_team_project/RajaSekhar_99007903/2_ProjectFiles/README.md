# Detecting Diferences

## Intro :

Differenciating between two images by a human is little hard. two reduce the or make the process easy, my project helps to find the require output. which also can be used in many of ways i.e. can be used for editing , police dept, Climate change detection etc,. developed the project is developed using some basic function on matlab ,simulink. 
Implemented the project on matlab as well as on simulink.

## Features
1. Detects the difference between two images
2. Shape detection
3. Color detection

## SWOT Analysis

## 4Ws & 1H
### What
The System to spot difference between two images 
### Why
To ease the process of detecting differences between two images
### When
Whenever we want to compare two images & spot the differences
### Where
For Medical, editing, police prospectives, it can be used
### How
By using the matlab software we have designed it. by giving two images as input , we can get output image which has differences

## Requiremets
### High Level requirements

HLR ID | Description 
-|-
HLR 01 | Spotting differeces between two images 
HLR 02 | Spotting colors difference
HLR 03 | spotting shapes difference

### High Level requirements
LLRID | Description | HLR ID
-|-|-
LLR01 | Changes accurate | HLR01
LLR02| detectingsame or ferent color | HLR02
LLR03 |detectingsame or different shapes | HLR03
