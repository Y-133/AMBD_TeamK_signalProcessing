## SWOT Ananlysis
### Strength
User can choose the background and this system will change the background by the use of masking the foreground selection.
### Weakness
The subject selection and masking could have been finer.
### Opportunities
User can change background without any editing software just by including some add ons in Matlab.
### Threats
In the market, better versions of this feature are used by using AI.
