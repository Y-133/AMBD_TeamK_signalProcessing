## Metric Dashboard

* The Metrics Dashboard calculates metric data per component. A component can be a model, subsystem, chart, or MATLAB Function block. You can view results in either a Table or Tree view. For the High Integrity and MAB compliance widgets, you can also choose a Grid view.
* It advise on how to better the logic (eg:much of the code can be reused blocks).
