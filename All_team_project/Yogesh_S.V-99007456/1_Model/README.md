# MATLAB MODEL DIAGRAM:

### In this project the amplitude modulation and demodulation is being simulated using the MatLab Simulink tool. In adiition to this wireless communication tool box was also used. ###

## MODULATION SYSTEM:

### This system is used to modulate the fed carrier signal and then it is superimposed on the signal to be transmitted and then transmitted using the antenna. 

## DEMODULATION SYSTEM:

### The modulated signal received at the receiver is demodulated and the signal is extracted.
