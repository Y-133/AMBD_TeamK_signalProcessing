# Background Manipulator

#
## Introduction: ##
#### Change Background of images for using Matlab. The project aims to extract people out of the given image and overlay them over specified backgrounds.

## High Level Requirements
| Id          |  High Level Requirements  |    status  |
| :--        | :--          |   :--     |
| HLR1        | The system should take only images     | Implemented |
| HLR2        | The system should process the images of same size only |  Implemented|
| HLR3        | The system should mask the subject out | Implemented |
| HLR4        | The system should print the image with changed background | Implemented |

## SWOT Ananlysis
### Strength
User can choose the background and this system will change the background by the use of masking the foreground selection.
### Weakness
The subject selection and masking could have been finer.
### Opportunities
User can change background without any editing software just by including some add ons in Matlab.
### Threats
In the market, better versions of this feature are used by using AI.
